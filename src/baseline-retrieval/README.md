Baseline system. 
Measure similarity between entries using TF-IDF.
BLEU score shown as below:
BLEU = 45.16, 76.5/52.6/37.7/27.5 (BP=1.000, ratio=1.014, hyp_len=20638, ref_len=20344)

In case you need to run the whole program, you need to install Gensim( https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html ), then modify "run_baseline_retrieval.sh" and you are good to go.
